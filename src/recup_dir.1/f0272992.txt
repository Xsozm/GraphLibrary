# for different users. This is currently at runtime only used
# to make new created network settings files only editable by
# root:root. The existence of this chown call is only that its
# used for some tests where a different user:group combination
# will be supplied.
# FIXME: adjust after seccomp argument filtering lands so that
# we only allow chown and its variant to be called for root:root
# and nothign else (LP: #1446748)
